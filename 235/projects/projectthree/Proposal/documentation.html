                    <p><strong>Geomancy</strong> is a bullet-hell game played on a grid. The player takes on the role of a vizard who must combine movement and a Siphon mechanic (similar to <em>Ikaruga's</em> polarity switching) to survive and defeat a massive Evil Tree.</p>

                    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-list"></i> Developer Notes & Reflections</h2>
                    <p>I might not have been able to fully realize the concepts on the proposal, but I am very happy with how the game turned out.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Notes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After struggling to implement advanced screen effects (CRT filters, bloom, and other effects) for hours, I abandoned the idea and stuck to the default renderer. It sucks because I really wanted to add them.. But alas.</li>
                        <li>Time was a major issue. I had to work on this, as well as 2 other games and 1 other 3D modeling project simultaneously with similar due dates.</li>
                        <li>I don't know if the game is beatable right now as I have not been able to beat it after the final difficulty increase. This means I couldn't test the logic for the game's ending. The logic for winning was working before, but I made minor changes that I was not able to test before submission.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section class="card">
                    <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-shoe-prints"></i> Development Process</h2>
                    <p>Like Project 2, my process was characterized by trial and error. I leveraged my existing knowledge of the MonoGame framework to translate those skills over to the PixiJS library, which was quite similar.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Development Phases</h3>
                    <ol class="process-list">
                        <li><strong>Core Gameplay First:</strong> I initially placed my focus on on main gameplay features like movement, shooting, and damage to have a concept ready for critique day.</li>
                        <li><strong>Feature Completion:</strong> After a short break to focus on other projects, the remaining features such as the completed siphon mechanic were completed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aesthetics & Polish:</strong> After completing the features work shifted to fixing bugs, implementing aesthetics and animation, and playtesting while tweaking values until the game felt decent.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                    <p>I don't want to keep developing this in pixi.js. I love the concept and would love to develop it further, but I’d port it over to Unity or a different potentially continuing.</p>
